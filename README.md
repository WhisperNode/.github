Who Are We
Whispernode is a grassroots validator team that's 100% focused on decentralization, security, & the cosmos ecosystem. We started with just one validator on Secret Network and have now grown to supporting 20+ networks. We love the Web3 space and consider ourselves blessed to be able to do what we do everyday. We strive to be incrementally better at what we do every single day, and thus reinvest a lot of our resources from delegators into improving WhisperNode.

WhisperNode works 24/7 to ensure that delegators can sleep peacefully, knowing their funds are #SAFU. Our team utilizes dedicated Bare Metal servers around the world, multiple 24/7 alerting systems, and a remote signing solution with always-ready backups. 


We differentiate ourselves through our public infrastructure like API node, governance participation, and community engagement. 
Our Infrastructure
Servers:

Whispernode currently rents bare metal servers in multiple locations around the world. We are not reliant on one provider OR one geographic location. We utilize providers like Leaseweb, AWS, OVHCloud, Hetzner, Hivelocity and MEVspace, spread across multiple geographic locations. 

For our setup we have a validator and multiple sentry nodes for each network. We use the  TMKMS Key Management System to separate key management from Tendermint nodes, improve security, ensure high quality access to validator keys, and prevent double-signing. 

Monitoring:

We are actively testing new monitoring & alerting solutions.  Currently we run multiple Tenderduty/Pagerduty instances, which monitor our nodes 24/7/365. If we miss 10+ blocks, we're immediately alerted via SMS/push notifications. After 3 mins, it spam calls us (not fun when you’re sleeping!)

In addition we’re running PANIC (node alerts via Telegram), HalfLife (realtime Discord node alerts), and UptimeRobot. 

These give a clear picture of every single node at ALL times, & massive redundancy in case 1 or more fail to alert us (for any reason).

We utilize the following as our monitoring solutions:
Zabbix
Prometheus
Tenderduty
Our Contributions

We provide public RPC, API, and gRPC endpoints for every network (available in chain directory / https://cosmos.directory/). We’re on track to hit about 300M queries a month. 
P2P Peer IDs (available in chain directory / https://cosmos.directory/) 
REStake for every chain AuthZ is enabled on (including our own REStake frontend)
